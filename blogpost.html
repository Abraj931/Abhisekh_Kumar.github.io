            Reading is typically an individual activity, done silently, although on occasion a person reads out loud
            for other listeners; or reads aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension.
            Before the reintroduction of separated text (spaces between words) in the late Middle Ages, the ability
            to read silently was considered rather remarkable.
            
            Major predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and non-alphabetic scripts are oral
            language skills, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and verbal IQ.

            As a leisure activity, children and adults read because it is pleasant and interesting. In the US, about
            half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year. About 5% read more than 50 books per
            year. Americans read more if they: have more education, read fluently and easily, are female, live in
            cities, and have higher socioeconomic status. Children become better readers when they know more about                 the world in general, and when they perceive reading as fun rather than another chore to be
            performed.</b>

            Learning to read or reading skills acquisition is the acquisition and practice of the skills necessary to
            understand the meaning behind printed words. For a skilled reader, the act of reading feels simple,
            effortless, and automatic.However, the process of learning to read is complex and builds on cognitive,
            linguistic, and social skills developed from a very early age. As one of the four core language skills
            (listening, speaking, reading and writing), reading is vital to gaining a command of the written
            language.

            In the United States and elsewhere, it is widely believed that students who lack proficiency in reading by
            the end of grade three may face obstacles for the rest of their academic career. For example, it
            is estimated that they would not be able to read half of the material they will encounter in grade four.

            In 2019, with respect to the reading skills of grade-four US public school students, only 44% of white
            students and 18% of black students performed at or above the proficient level of the Nations Report
            Card. Also, in 2012, in the United Kingdom it has been reported that 15-year-old students are reading at
            the age of 12-year-old students.

            As a result, many governments put practices in place to ensure that students are reading at grade level by
            the end of grade three. An example of this is the Third Grade Reading Guarantee created by the State of Ohio
            in 2017. This is a program to identify students from kindergarten through grade three that are behind in
            reading, and provide support to make sure they are on track for reading success by the end of grade
            three. This is also known as remedial education. Another example is the policy in England whereby
            any pupil who is struggling to decode words properly by year three must "urgently" receive help through a
            "rigorous and systematic phonics programme

            In 2016, out of 50 countries, the United States achieved the 15th highest score in grade-four reading
            ability.[70] The ten countries with the highest overall reading average are the Russian Federation,
            Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Finland, Poland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Chinese Taipei and England
            (UK). Some others are: Australia (21st), Canada (23rd), New Zealand (33rd), France (34th), Saudi Arabia
            (44th), and South Africa (50th).
